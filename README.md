Automotive. Surveillance(Computer Vision):
Computer vision has been greatly used to automate supervision and generate appropriate action and trigger if the event is predicted from the image of interest. In this project if a car moving on the road can be easily identified by a camera as make of the car, type, colour, number plates etc. In this project, we have a ‘Cars’ dataset which contains 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars. The data is split into 8,144 training images and 8,041 testing images, where each class has been split roughly in a 50-50 split. Classes are typically at the level of Make, Model, Year, E.g., 2012 Tesla Model S or 2012 BMW M3 coupe. Aim of this project is to build a deep learning model to predict the bounding box around the car and the corresponding Class of the car in the image.
  Skills and Tools:, Keras, OpenCV , Image augmentation techniques, SSD with MobileNet,   Faster R-CNN with inception, VGGNet.


Sarcasm Detection(Natural Language Processing):
The goal of this hands-on project is to analyse the headlines of the articles from news sources and detect whether they are sarcastic or not.
  Skills and Tools:GloVe, Classication, LSTM

Implementing a Image classification neural network to classify Street House View Numbers (Neural Networks):
SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing object recognition algorithms with a requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network.
  Skills and Tools:Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Keras, Image Recognition

Product Recommendation Systems (Recommendation Systems):
This project involved building recommendation systems for Amazon products. A popularity-based model and a collaborative Filtering model were used and evaluated to recommend top-10 products for a user.
  Skills and Tools: Collaborative Filtering, Recommender Systems, Python
.

Predicting the Strength of high performance concrete (Featurization, Model Selection & Tuning):
This project involved feature exploration and selection to predict the strength of high-performance concrete. Used Regression models like Decision tree regressors to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross-validation techniques and Grid search were used to tune the parameters for best model performance.
  Skills and Tools:Regression, Decision trees, feature engineering

Classifying silhouettes of vehicles (Unsupervised Learning):
Classified vehicles into different types based on silhouettes which may be viewed from many angles. Used PCA in order to reduce dimensionality and SVM for classification.
  Skills and Tools:Support Vector Machines, Principal Component Analysis, Classification


Predicting the term-deposit subscription (Ensemble Techniques):
Leveraged customer information of bank marketing campaigns to predict whether a customer will subscribe to term deposit or not. Different classification algorithms like Decision tree, Logistic Regression were used. Ensemble techniques like Random forest were used to further improve the classification results.
  Skills and Tools:Classification, Decision Tress, Ensemble Techniques

Identifying potential customers for loans (Supervised Learning):
Identified potential loan customers for Thera Bank using classification techniques. Compared models built with Logistic Regression and KNN algorithm in order to select the best performing one.
  Skills and Tools:Logistic Regression, KNN, Classification


Health Insurance (Applied Statistics):
This project used Hypothesis Testing and Visualization to leverage customer's health information like smoking habits, bmi, age, and gender for checking statistical evidence to make valuable decisions of insurance business like charges for health insurance.
  Skills and Tools:Hypothesis Testing, Data visualisation, statistical Inference
