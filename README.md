Predicting the Strength of high performance concrete
This project involved feature exploration and selection to predict the strength of high-performance concrete. Used Regression models like Decision tree regressors to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross-validation techniques and Grid search were used to tune the parameters for best model performance.

Skills and Tools

Regression, Decision trees, feature engineering

Classifying silhouettes of vehicles
Classified vehicles into different types based on silhouettes which may be viewed from many angles. Used PCA in order to reduce dimensionality and SVM for classification.

Skills and Tools

Support Vector Machines, Principal Component Analysis, Classification
